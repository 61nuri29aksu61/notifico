# Notifico!

Notifico is my personal open source ([MIT](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIT_License))
replacement to the now-defunct http://cia.vc service with my own little spin on things.

Please note that this is extremely alpha software and likely has many flaws and
potential exploits. That said, it's safe to run your own copy with registrations
disabled.
